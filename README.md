### Description
With this mod everyone in your FTB Team will share one EMC Network (EMC and Knowledge). <br>
Items learnt before joining the team are learnt by the team and everyone in it when joining. <br>
Your personal EMC will not get lost, it will simply use the team EMC while in a team, and the personal EMC while not. <br>
Team EMC starts at 0, no EMC will be transferred between members and the team. <br>
If you wish to transfer your EMC to the team network after adding this mod, take it out of your own network before joining a team, and then add it to the team network after joining.

-----

### Using the mod
To share EMC and/or Knowledge, join the same FTB Team and enable what you want to share in the team's settings. <br>
To open FTB Team settings, either use `/team settings` or click the settings button your team's GUI, which can be opened using the FTB Teams button on the top left of your inventory. <br>
The settings for sharing EMC and/or Knowledge will be in their own settings section named `ProjectETeams`, and can be changed anytime without requiring a restart.

-----

### Cleanroom
[Cleanroom](https://github.com/CleanroomMC/Cleanroom) is supported, but not tested as much as normal Forge. If you encounter any bugs, please open an issue. <br>
Cleanroom has mixinbooter included automatically, so with it, it's not required. <br>
Don't forget to add Fugue when using Cleanroom. <br>
