### Description
With this mod everyone in your FTB Team will share one EMC Network (EMC and Knowledge). <br>
Items learnt before joining the team are learnt by the team and everyone in it when joining. <br>
Your personal EMC will not get lost, it will simply use the team EMC while in a team, and the personal EMC while not. <br>
Team EMC starts at 0, no EMC will be transferred between members and the team. <br>
If you wish to transfer your EMC to the team network after adding this mod, take it out of your own network before joining a team, and then add it to the team network after joining.
